=============

This is were we will try and keep the 4 source files.  Try to not add object files or executables. Source code only.

Please put compiling instructions as well as sample input below.

Instructions:

Examples/UDP:

For the UDP Server and Client example the easiest way to compile is run: ./go.cmd
Note: You may have to type: “chmod 775 go.cmd” this will give you run access.

After these are compiled, you need to run the server: ./server.exe

Then run the client: ./client [NameOfYourMachine] testing_string

You can find your machine name by typing: “hostname”

If this runs correctly you should see the client talk to the server and the server respond with an echo, while changing the second character to ‘%’
